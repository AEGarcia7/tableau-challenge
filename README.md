# Tableau Challenge (Citi Bike Data)

## **Description:** 
Using data gathered by the New York Citi Bike Program, I will answer the questions whether or not the incoming summer is impacting bike usage in a positive way and where in the city the most usage of the bikes is and possibly why.

1. There were over 80 thousand people using bikes in May and excluding the first day of the month, every single day had more users that were yearly members than more casual users with 3 or 7 day passes. Classic and electric bikes were used the most out of the bike types with the docked type only getting around 100 users on a good day. Looking at the amount of users on the days there were the most and least, it seems to suggest that while the month went on, more and more people came out and used the bikes.

2. The biggest drop in the month was a week in due to it being rainiest and the coldest day of the month. On the other hand, two weeks later, the highest amount of users came on the 21st. This would mark a change in the amount of users, as starting on the 14th, people were using the bikes more and more, and in more consistent numbers than the slow increase after the 7th. All of this seems to confirm that the incoming summer and the clearing of the weather seems to be the reason for the increase of users throughout the month.

3. The consistently highest areas of bike pickup seems to be around areas such as City Hall, Hoboken Terminal, and Grove St Path which all seem to be closer to the river than the inner parts of the city. This might be explained due to a lack of public transportation due to it being near the edge of the river and the trains not being able go in any direction other than North/South and the buses also not being able to go East/West due to the bottleneck that is the Holland Tunnel. This could be supported by the fact that the only consistent big pick up spot further into the city seems to be at Sip Ave.
